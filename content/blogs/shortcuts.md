# Why shortcuts?
Typing on Keyboard is fast. Mouse slow. Need I say more?

These shortcuts are mostly universal and default, so they should apply to stuff you're already doing.

# The Essential Computers
## The "Ctrl" alphabet
*Work in just about all situations*

- `Ctrl + A`: Select **A**ll

- `Ctrl + B`: Make highlighted text **B**old, or make the cursor bold

- `Ctrl + C`: **C**opy text

- `Ctrl + E`: c**E**nter text

- `Ctrl + F`: Search for text (**F**ind)

- `Ctrl + G`: **G**o to page...

- `Ctrl + H`: Find & Replace (not sure where the **H** came from...) 

- `Ctrl + I`: Make text **I**talicized 

- `Ctrl + K`: Insert lin**K** (if text is highlighted, make selected text the word content of the link) 

- `Ctrl + L`: **L**eft align text

- `Ctrl + S`: **S**ave file/project

- `Shift + Arrow` (any direction): Highlight letters

- `Ctrl + [Left|Right]`: Bounce between words

- `Ctrl + Shift + [Left|Right]`: Highlight words

- `Ctrl + Delete`: Delete forwards by word (by itself, delete erases words in front of cursor)

- `Ctrl + Backspace`: Erase by word (as opposed to by a letter, see a pattern with `Ctrl`?)

- `Ctrl + [+|-]`: Zoom in/out

## Extras
- `/`: jump to search bar in search engines

- `Ctrl + Enter`: Insert new line instead of sending a message (in contexts where you're sending messages)

# Conclusion
I use 60-70% of these shortcuts day-to-day. If you likewise use a computer daily, commit some of these to memory, write them down, or better yet, try using some of these, as that teaches most people best

Yes, most of these are from memory, and no, I'm not really a keyboard shortcut enthusiast. There are people who can navigate their whole computers with a keyboard; while this gets you most of the way there, it's certainly not all of the shortcuts that are out there.
